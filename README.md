The project aims to develop a comprehensive system for fake review detection and product recommendation, leveraging machine learning algorithms to enhance the user experience on an e-commerce platform. The system begins by scraping reviews from Amazon, a leading online marketplace, to gather data for analysis. 

Upon accessing the website, users are presented with detailed product information along with initial ratings. However, these ratings are subject to refinement through a machine learning algorithm designed to identify and filter out fake reviews. 

Furthermore, the project integrates a personalized recommendation system based on users' previous search histories. By analyzing past interactions and preferences, the system generates tailored recommendations to enhance the shopping experience and facilitate product discovery. 
Overall, the project aims to address the challenges of fake reviews, improve rating accuracy, and provide users with personalized recommendations, thereby enhancing their overall satisfaction and trust in the platform. 

The goals of the project can be summarized as follows: 
● Enhanced Customer Trust: Build a platform where customers can rely on genuine reviews to make informed purchasing decisions, thereby fostering trust in the recommendations provided. 
● Improved User Experience: Create a seamless and user-friendly interface that allows customers to easily navigate through products, reviews, and recommendations. 
● Accurate Product Recommendations: Utilize the KNN-Cosine AI model to analyze user preferences and historical data to provide personalized and accurate product recommendations tailored to each customer's needs and preferences. 
●  Effective Fake Review Detection: Implement the SVM-LR AI model to identify and remove fake reviews, ensuring that only genuine feedback influences the recommendation algorithm. This helps maintain the integrity and reliability of the platform. 
● Scalability and Performance: Design the system to handle large volumes of data and user traffic efficiently, ensuring fast response times and scalability as the platform grows.
