B0000SX2UC,Zachary O. Toups,1,29-Nov-04,"Slow, annoying, fragile, heavy, and bulky...","1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night.",
B0000SX2UC,esti,5,8-Sep-04,Worth paying more for something else.,"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.",
B0000SX2UC,brittho,5,17-Aug-04,Great free phone for Sprint customers.,This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.,
B0009N5L7K,Marcel Thomas,1,5-Mar-16,Stupid phone,DON'T BUY OUT OF SERVICE,
B0009N5L7K,William B.,5,9-Feb-06,Exellent Service,I have been with nextel for nearly a year now I started out this time last year with the Motorola i205 and just upgraded to the i265 it is one of the best phones I have ever had the service is the best I have ever had I have no problems making or reciving calls. If you are considering nextel give it a shot they are in my opinion the best cell company out there.,
B0009N5L7K,K. Mcilhargey,5,7-Feb-06,I love it,"I just got it and have to say its easy to use, i can hear the person talking just fine and i have had no problems dealing with nextel.",
B0009N5L7K,Stephen Cahill,1,20-Dec-16,Phones locked,1 star because the phones locked so I have to pay additional fees to unlock it,
B0009N5L7K,Mihir,5,13-Dec-09,Excellent product,The product has been very good. I had used this cell phone in one of my projects and it worked wonders. I will definitely recommend this to anyone interested in buying it....,
B0009N5L7K,L. Hughes,5,21-Jul-05,WARNING,"My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message ""network not available"". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.",
B0009N5L7K,1 Stop 4 Whats HOT,5,27-Jun-09,NEXTEL BOOST PHONE,GREAT PRODUCT THAT IS AS GREAT FOR NEXTEL AS IT IS FOR BOOST INSERT YOUR SIM & GO!,
B000SKTZ0S,Thomas,4,17-Sep-10,"Nice, but","I bought this phone to replace an LG phone that I didn't like. As I expected, all I had to do was put the old SIM card in the new phone and it worked. There are two serious drawbacks to this device, both related to the candy bar style. First, all the buttons are exposed, so it's easy to hit one accidentally. Second, the screen is easily scratched. This one got scratched making it difficult to read in sunlight. Aside from those two flaws, the phone works great. Connectivity, battery life, and quality of voice are superb. Since I don't do texting I can't comment on that. It is nice and small, and if it came with a case, or if I could find a case for it, then it would be perfect for my needs. The price was right. Now I have a new SIM card with $10 worth of calling on it that I don't need.",
B000SKTZ0S,"Kei, San Jose, CA",1,13-May-17,It seems it doesn't work with the existing AT&T SIM card.,"I purchased this phone for my AT&T phone replacement, even though one of the FAQ mentioned it works with AT&T SIM, in my case, it didn't. Since this is my primary phone, in stead of spending time to see the reason, I'll go with other phone, which specifically says it's ""unlocked"".",

B000SKTZ0S,R-Dash,3,10-Feb-09,does the job,I got this phone just as secondary cell phone. It is really lightweight and very cheap. The receiption is good. But most of the time a windy noise is heard when somebody is calling to this cell phone.,

B000SKTZ0S,Trevor Arms,1,11-Feb-14,This phone gave me a concussion. and may come with a faulty battery.,"I asked my friend to toss me my phone, but what he heard was ""Hey, throw that phone as hard as you can at my head"", so he did. Hit me square in the temple and I dropped. Needless to say this is a very sturdy phone, very simple and easy to use, long battery life (Like really long, like Stretch Armstrong long), takes being dropped and smacked around like a champ. If this phone was my son, i'd be proud, and afraid. The texting takes a little to get used to, but I digress. Smart Phones are for dummies. P.S you can create your own ringtones on this phone, provides way more entertainment than Flappy Bird.",
B000SKTZ0S,zzzzzzzzzz,5,10-Apr-08,Tough phone,"We never use cell phones, but thought we needed one for a long road trip. With our last phone we were always irritated that the battery seemed to be dead every time we tried to use it. Based on reviews, we chose this phone. Battery life is great! And the phone really does handle abuse very well. My husband forgot it was in his shirt pocket. The phone went through the washer and dryer and still works as well as ever!! I'm not sure how it would work as an everyday phone, but for those who only need it occasionally I would highly recommend. It will be there, charged and ready when you need it.",
B000SKTZ0S,Valli LaMar,5,21-Jun-12,4-1/2 years!,"I have had this model phone for 4-1/2 years and only now the battery is beginning to fail. FANTASTIC little phone that doesn't drop calls, can stick in a pocket or purse easily, does exactly what it is supposed to do at an unbeatable price. Refill for $100 and get a bonus $5.",
B000SKTZ0S,S. Chan,5,3-Oct-07,simply great!,"Easy to use features, slim in size at a very good price. It is better compare to my exsiting T-Mobile prepaid phone. I called from a landline to both phones and the at& t picked up within 13 seconds while the T-Mobile at 25 sec or most of the time, just jumped to my voice mail only. I highly recommend at&t.",
B000SKTZ0S,SlashMaster1,5,25-Sep-07,More than great,"This phone is great. Simple to use, great battery life, always has a strong signal and AT&T has a great pay-as-you go plan. I'm happy.",
B000SKTZ0S,Sirni,4,13-Feb-08,motorola c168i,It is just a basic phone and is an effective phone for people who do not need a lot of features. The size is good.,
B000SKTZ0S,Carolyn V. Nettleship,4,19-Jul-08,Good little phone,"this is a good little inexpensive phone - basic, but that's what I wanted! Just a phone for my pay as you go plan!",
B000SKTZ0S,PortlandHome,5,29-Oct-10,Great phone,"I almost never write reviews for anything, but this stupid little cheap phone has proven so reliable and indestructible that I just had to say something. I bought this phone at least 3 (maybe 4) years ago, after two ""fancy"" (expensive) flip phones each lasted less than a year before falling apart. My goal was not to buy a phone that would last 4 years (I didn't expect any phone would) and certainly was not to buy a $20 phone that would last 4 years. My goal was just not to spend $150 on another phone. I hoped it might last 6 months, until I decided what to do next (change service providers, get a new contract with a free phone, etc.) To my surprise, this little brick of a phone just keeps going. It has not been treated lightly (I recently opened up the back to find the serial #, and found it full of dirt & dust). It has crashed with me skiing, been splashed with salt water while sailing, and been drenched in sweat while in my bike jersey. Still, it works. Complaints: I dearly wish it had a camera, even a crappy one. Sometimes the exposed buttons get pressed accidentally. It has no fancy features. But I'm going to buy another one-- just in case this one ever quits. UPDATE 1/1/12: This phone is still going. 5+ years now. I bought this phone when the first-generation iPhone came out. Four generations of iPhone later, I still don't have one, because this phone has refused to die. Incredible.",
B000SKTZ0S,Big Cadillac,5,7-Jun-09,Perfect Bare-Bones and Practically Indestructible Phone!,"I have had the C168i for two years as a replacement for a different phone I broke. Note that it is a ""goPhone"" but you can use any monthly ATT service with it just by putting your SIM card in. My friends make fun of me for my boring looking phone, but they have since gone through 4-5 $150-200 phones while my $20 ""crap"" phone is still going and going... This phone is perfect for someone who doesn't need a camera, videos, bell and whistles stuff, but wants a sturdy reliable phone with a long battery life. It is also very inexpensive. Also, I attest to the main review that this phone is a ""TERMINATOR"" phone, meaning it is EXTREMELY resistant to almost all forms of physical harm. I have never tried soaking it in water, but I have dropped it, thrown it, scraped it, kicked it etc. and the screen and battery are still perfectly functional. Great battery life as well. My battery has NEVER run out on me. EVER! And I am super-negligent when it comes to charging it. Of course, the phone really only has normal calling and basic texting. The only complaint I would make is that entering new contacts into the address book is somewhat difficult and counter-intuitive until you learn how to do it. You won't regret buying this phone.",
B000SKTZ0S,Linda,4,20-May-08,Motorola Fan,"I've been using this phone for about three weeks, now, and it truly is a nice little phone. It's small, light, and the keypad and screen really light up...you can actually see the screen in very bright sunlight! It does everything I want a phone to do. The graphics on the web are really very good, although accessing the web is rather slow. The keypad IS quite small, and this could be a problem for most men, but it's perfect for me. The only negative is that it doesn't have speaker phone capability. The battery life is, as the others have said, amazing! As for the person whose wife's phone was dead, it probably was jostled in her purse and was inadvertently turned on. I prefer bar phones to any other kind (not sure why), and one of the first things I learned was to lock the keypad whenever I put it in my purse, in my pocket, or any other place where it would be possible for the phone to be accidentally turned on. It's a simple matter of pushing two keys to turn on the lock or to shut it off, and sure saves a lot of battery life.",
B000SKTZ0S,Mario C,5,23-Aug-07,Solid phone,"Well, my phone that came with my service plan is.. well.. its now a paper weight (darn razrs!!) I didnt want to spend another 100+ on a phone that wil just break, then i stumbled upon these gophones, they are from 19.99-99.99 at best buy and work perfectly with my AT&T monthly subscription SIM card, so its just a crazy cheap phone. The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too. VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover. came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection. it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards. my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone. ---- I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried. I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke. I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on. After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does. It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something. I highly recommend this phone. I'm going to buy another one soon, heck I might even pick up 2 one for an emergency replacement.",
B000SKTZ0S,Love Gadgets,3,29-Oct-07,Great disposible phone?,"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about). And it does look pretty good as a paper weight.",
B000SKTZ0S,RJD,4,16-Dec-07,two for one!,"I needed a temporary phone for a friend in a retirement home until he got settled in his new place. I charged it up and it ran for several days on its own. He would have preferred a larger key pad due to his poor eyesight, but he seemed to do okay with it, and it was simple enough for him to be able to use it to simply make or receive calls (I didn't get into the answering system with him!). Now that he has moved and has his landline installed, I am giving it to a friend who has no cell phone, and cannot afford the price of a regular one. This will be just right for her limited calls when she is on the road. So.... two for the price of one!!",
B001AO4OUC,Elizabeth,4,12-May-09,tough little phone,"This phone isn't kidding when it says military specs. I had a hole in my pocket and it went tumbling down a flight of concrete steps (20 steps). It had a few scratches but it worked fine. It also made a few other death - defying leaps. It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one. My only pet peeve with this phone is they could have at least given me ONE full game - not the lame demos that are included with it. The phone itself is about the size of a Hershey bar. I often keep it in my pants pocket (the front pocket).",

B001AO4OUC,Yoda,4,7-Apr-10,For a basic phone quite good,"For someone needing a very basic phone and services (i.e., no email access, no camera, etc.) this phone is quite good. The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other ""basic"" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone's features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow. Hence if you need to use such a feature this phone is far from optimal. All and all a very good phone despite the weaknesses cited above. If someone is looking for a barebones phone this is more than fulfills the requirements.",
B001AO4OUC,MayaMan,5,13-Apr-11,Terrible Customer Service,"I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with? I deeply regret selecting to business with this company.",
B001AO4OUC,Butch,5,26-Aug-09,Excellent Choice Cell Phone,"I picked this up to use with Boost Mobile. All I wanted was a phone with walkie talkie and this fit the bill. I have a digital camera for pictures, phones don't need a camera. This phone has not dropped one call since I activated it. Everytime I DT with someone it works. This phone gets a signal where T-Mobile, Sprint and all others fail. The buttons for texting and replying to emails are easy to handle. If you are looking for a ""phone"" this is the one to get. I would give this 10 starts if it were allowed. Another plus is it handles mp3's & GIF images which I upload from my own PC to the phone.",
B001AO4OUC,Butch,5,13-Aug-09,Great phone,"This phone is awesome. I have one through Boost Mobile with the unlimited plan. Bought it on August 6th and no regrets. People that whine and complain about the screen res or no games. It's a phone people, nothing more, nothing less. I use the walkie-talkie regularly, my wife and I text back and forth daily with no missed or missing messages. This phone receives/makes calls and walkie-talkie's where others have failed. If people want games buy a Gameboy, want pictures buy a camera, not real hard to figure out. This little gem was built to be a phone and that's exactly what it is. In short.... See it as it really is, a phone.",
B001AO4OUC,Gabriel Barco,5,19-Jul-09,GREAT PHONE,"i dont want to sound like a hot head but i havent had the best luck with cell phones, when i get a bad call the phone goes flying. this phone has impressed me with its durablity, i have thrown it, droped it and it even went flying out of my cars window while on the street when i wasnt looking, and it still works. best phone i ever bought. why would you buy a phone that cost $400 and worry every time you drop it, when if this one falls you just brush off the dirt and go on your way.",
B001AO4OUC,Palamabron,1,1-Sep-11,"ok as phone, that's it","I find texting impossible on this phone. As another reviewer said, the screen goes blank randomly and you have to turn it off and on again.

B001AO4OUC,jncti,1,30-Jun-10,Not a good product,"I recently had an i776 which was ruined at work. I had good service with it and it worked well. I spent $50 on this piece, the service is horrible, very patchy. I don't receive texts, sometimes the screens goes white for no reason. The key pad lights stopped working, the phone has no alarm. The battery doesn't last more than a day. I have only had to phone for two months. Its the worst phone ive owned, do not buy this. The i776 is a good phone,but you have to buy the rugged version.",

B001AO4OUC,C. YOUNG,1,3-Aug-09,This phone was designed by the devil.,"This phone is JUNK. Do NOT buy this phone. You will have much faster messaging via regular USPS. Your text messages will be lost in the vast time warp of boost mobilism where they will stay until you decide to try to use the internet on this phone. While waiting the regular 15 minutes for a webpage to load, you will be bumrushed by a million of delayed texts which will obliterate all the efforts this sorry little phone has put forth in trying to load the webpage. The screen will turn white and the entire phone will reset on its own. You will then have the responsibility of manually turning your transmitters back on for the phone to work again. If you are arguing with a girlfriend on this phone, she will dump you because she will think you have hung up on her. If you have close family members, they will abandon you and make pacts with other family members not to call or text you because you never text back and hardly ever answer. If you are having an affair with a married woman, this phone will hold all the messages you sent to her until her husband has come home. Then, like magic, this phone will deliver all the long lost messages as soon as he picks up his wife's phone. They should reaname this phone the i666. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for this phone, but common sense makes one wonder if it wasn't created by a more sinister power. Possibly Satan himself.",

B001GQ3DJM,Nathan Gaida,5,18-Nov-08,Ok phone to tide me over,"Short: This phone works fine as a basic phone, if that is all you are looking for. Long: My old phone's LCD croaked on me, and I wanted to wait a bit before buying an HTC Dream, so I went with this cheap phone. Complaints: Menu/key response is sometimes slow. No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US. It seems like a USB cable exists (in Europe, Asia and Australia) but it costs about as much as the phone itself does after exchange rates. If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for ""authorized personal only"", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method. In any event, I'll be getting a new phone in a few months so I'll live with this phone for now. But the limitations it has makes it so that it is only suitable for those who are not looking for anything other than making/receiving phone calls (like my parents).",
B001GQ3DJM,Bo Peep,1,2-Aug-09,lousy phone,"The good news is that it has a long battery life and is lightweight. But none of that is worth anything if you cant hear the other person. I had a Samsung and a Sony before and never had this problem. The keypad is tough, requiring sledge hammer to push the keys. Bottom line: the phone is cheap, but you get what you pay for. Try Sony or Samsung, their cheapest models work better than this.",
B001GQ3DJM,AM Radio,5,21-Dec-08,Good basic phone for the money,"I needed a replacement phone, and did not want to sign up for a new contract, so I bought a Nokia 1680c at the full retail price. This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I'm calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I'm on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a ""+"" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example ""+15551212121"" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example. Overall, I like this phone, and will probably keep it until I someday feel the need to get a smartphone-type slab of electronics.",
B0029F2O3A,P. Dharmavarapu,1,23-Sep-09,Worst Experience with Amazon,"This is probably the wrost experience i had with Amazon and it costed me $72.00. Both my phones from amazon arrived inright time but without activation. I called AT&T and they could not locate our phone numbers so had to call back amazon and learned that they have not activated our phones. Amazon customer service took good amount of time to do this meanwhile i missed by billing cycle with old cell phone company. This process took about a week, and not to mention the SIM card delivered was not working and amazon had to ship again.",
B0029F2O3A,petlover,5,9-Mar-10,A simple phone for texting and making calls,"By simple I mean that in a good way, having come from an Envy 2 I am glad to be able to open the phone and dial and not have to deal with clicking OK twice to unlock the ""locked"" screen. Quotes intentional, the screen was only locked when I needed to urgently make a call but had a lot of phantom dialing while in my pocket. So back to the Alias 2 the phone is easy to figure out but does not work in all the ways it is said to work. Specifically I can not get this phone to pair with my blue tooth in my new car. I tried, the car dealer tried and while NO issues are reported with this phone and its blue tooth capabilities I beg to differ! I read another review of a person who had exact same trouble with a different model car and was also told the phone is fine. It is obviously something unique to this model only because other samsung phones pair without problems. I got my phone exchanged and after going through that it still will not pair with my car. I wanted this phone because it is simpler than the previous envy 2 I owned but even that phone will pair with my car. I plan to switch to a smart phone as soon as the Nexus One comes to verizon. Considering the very large increase in the monthly charges they will thus receive and extending my contract I sincerely hope they work as hard to keep the customer happy as they say they do. This customer is not terribly happy right now! I will say that the network is the strongest for my area so I hope to stick with verizon but can and will change if they wont try and keep me satisfied.",
B0029F2O3A,John Doe,5,9-Jul-09,Solid Phone,"Just recently got this phone as a replacement to my i760 and am happy to be back to a flip phone. Great Camera, have not tested video yet. Battery life is solid. I'll give samsung credit for the rotating/changable keyboard, a cool thing for the next model might be a customizable keyboard where you have the ability to assign values to each key. As far as ease of use for the keyboard...I havent had any problems and I have large hands/fingers. It takes a little getting used to but once acclimated you should have no problems. I cant comment on voice recognition or blue tooth as I dont really use those features and honestly find them useless (once in a while I'll use my ear piece in the car but its rare). I also dont plan on using it as an MP3 player...I have an ipod for that. If your looking for a phone to synch with outlook then find one where that is offered in the specs. Yes you can remotely sync and get access to web email but nowhere in the description is outlook mentioned so I cant hold that against the phone. It would be like faulting my car cause it doesnt fly (I know thats an exageration but its kinda the same thing) when its clearly not meant for that. If you need a phone that syncs with outlook then get a pda phone. This is basically your standard flip with a few extra features and probly wont be as popular with the mickey mouse club kids that want an iPhone like device that they can watch movies on and giggle over the txts their friends just sent. Interface is about the same as any other VZ flip phone I've had in the past. The ability to use a 16gb micro sd is also a nice feature and is especially handy if you have a card reader on your pc/laptop. All in all its a solid phone that serves the purpose its intended for...a phone thats easy to txt on and make calls on.",
B0029F2O3A,M. Brennan,5,13-Oct-10,I like it but a few shortcomings are significant enough that I wouldn't buy it again if I lost it.,"Good overall phone, bluetooth so far syncs well with the integrated bluetooth in a Mercedes that I used to have and also with the aftermarket Alpine stereo that I have in my VW. But some of the features and design are just poor and/or not thought out. Looks great but the body is far too slippery. It's like handling a bar of soap. I use it as my primary alarm clock in the morning and it's really clumsy to grab off the nightstand and shut off the alarm. Even when I'm fully awake and alert :-) it's hard to open and I've dropped it a few times while fumbling to open it. There is a wider slit on the clamshell lid to fit your finger into when opening in portrait mode but in landscape mode there's no place to insert your finger to flip it open, so you have to use your fingernail. Unlike my previous phone, it takes two hands almost all the time to open this thing whereas my old phone I could easily flip it open with one hand. I wish the alarm clock's snooze function was like most clock radios where it allows 10 minutes snooze time, not 5. 5 is just too short. Or, the phone should allow you to set the snooze period as a preference. There is no way to display the time on the front screen when the phone is dark; you have to open it up. Well, you can fake it by holding the lock button for the music keys, which will light up the display) but then you have to hold it a second time to reset the lock/unlock back to where you had it. Also, when you're on a call (although just about every cell phone fails on this) the clock doesn't display anywhere (so this is no better than other phones). How many times have you been on a call and said ""Hey let's meet later!"" and the person asks you ""Ok, what time is it now?"" and you can't tell. (I quit wearing watches because of the clocks on cell phones...but why don't they display the time when on a call?) The keys on the outside aren't too bad except the volume up/down is a little too easy to accidentally press. I like the keyboard idea overall but I find it's like typing on little Chiclet gum candies. I need to use my fingernails to avoid fat-fingering it. In QWERTY mode, the END button is too close to the space bar and I have inadvertantly killed my web browser when typing a space in a field on a page. Frustrating! With the END key was farther away. Wish they would have also engineered in some page up/down keys too, as scrolling line by line is cumbersome. I would also like the END and SEND keys to somehow be the traditional red and green colors too. I use Outlook on my netbook to ""sync"" (sort of) my contacts to the phone. This works alright but if you want to refresh your contacts you have to delete them all from the phone and then resend them over or they'll be duplicates. This is a bit annoying only in that you will then need to re-enter the ICE contacts manually. The bluetooth can send pics to my netbook, but only one at a time (cumbersome). Can't select multiple photos at once. Won't send videos at all to my netbook via Bluetooth. Have to send them via a picture message to email and fake it that way but you incur data usage charges doing it that way. Or you can use removable storage on the MicroSD card to do it. The biggest disappointment is the calendar. What a useless piece of junk! It says you can send calendar appointments to the phone, which you can, but it is half-baked. If you set a reminder in Outlook, the reminder doesn't carry over to the phone. The phone only supports one text field for the appointment and it corresponds to the Outlook appointment body (not the header meeting description nor location), so I have to retype the description and location in the Outlook calendar body if I want to see anything useful on the phone. Even then, some appointments come over with an empty text field on the phone (it is either a problem with the text being too long and/or having a carriage return in the text I think). So if I try to then enter it on the phone (enter the description in the displayed (and empty) text field), the phone freezes and then reboots. Terrible! The recurring meeting also is miserably half-baked. You cannot set an interval like ""every other week"". I work a 9/80 work schedule and I want to have every other Friday that I work in my phone so I know when I'm off work or not. I can only choose daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. So while it does take Outlook calendar items, they end up so flawed and useless that if you really do plan on using this phone as an organizer, don't; it will fail to meet your needs. I understand that Samsung uses this same calendar in many of its products and if so, it will be a deal breaker next time around for me and I'll shop a different brand. The add-on Mobile Email from OZ isn't too bad but it also has room for improvement. It is billed as ""fully integrated"" but not in my eyes. While the phone itself has a limited file viewer for certain file types stored on it, if you receive an email with attachments (even if just a .jpg), the OZ mobile email doesn't support accessing attachments. This is not what I call ""fully integrated"". The OZ email client also works a bit inconsistently (although maybe it's an issue with the email providers and not OZ?). With my Cox POP3 accounts, I can only access the inbox (not sent items). With Yahoo and Hotmail, I can access the various folders OK. With my university's email account (hosted by Google GMAIL), it displays both the inbox and the sent items in the inbox (really weird, and I imagine if I had other folders it might lump everything togeter as well). The user interface for the OZ mobile email isn't too bad although it was a bit unintuitive to find how to add a recipient to an email from the phone's contacts. Can be done but just was hard to find. Also isn't clear on how to add multiple recipients (use a comma or semicolon between them? don't know...) Beware of Verizon's compusory data plan with this phone. It is misleading. Supposedly for $9.99 a month you get 25MB of data usage. This often isn't presented clearly. It applies only to the web browser. Texting and picture messaging are not part of this 25MB **even though they use a data connection!**. It should be called a ""web browsing plan"", not a ""data plan"". So unless you pay for an additional texting plan, you will be charged for each message. I was pretty furious when my first bill arrived to find I was charged for the picture messages I sent thinking it was part of my ""data plan"". The mp3 player is alright although once or twice it froze up on me and I had to restart the phone. The headphone jack is a nontypical 2.5mm so you will need an adapter to go to 3.5mm. Booooo. Battery life is so-so. If at work I listen to mp3s during the day and also do a little lunchtime web browsing for about 10-15 minutes, I can easily go from a full battery to dead in about 5-6 hours. I don't know if this is typical or not of most phones, but it'd be nice if the mp3s can make it through one whole workday, but it can't. Sound on the built-in speakers is decent for something so small.",
B0029F2O3A,D. Kashmiri,2,23-Sep-09,Not an upgrade over original Alias,"I loved my Samsung Alias, as most Alias owners do. I decided to purchase the Alias 2 on faith, assuming that Samsung had simply updated certain features of the original. I was mistaken. The first thing you will notice is the size; the alias 2 is taller, thicker, and wider than the original. If you are like me, one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it's super-slim design. I would say it's about 50% bulkier than the original. While the original slid into your jeans and disappeared, the new one will stick out like a sore thumb. I suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera/camcorder but I never used that feature too much in the first place. Ultimately, I would say this is the reason I returned the alias 2, but I also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen. When texting, you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers/symbols/punctuation marks that you need. In fact, the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it, so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters. The empty space is a theme on all screens in fact, in either orientation. As I said, I found this annoying (maybe only because I became so used to the 1000 figures/symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad). I ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original. I will keep my new every 2 discount until Verizon comes out with a very good Android or Apple finally relents with the iphone/At&T exclusivity.",
B0029F2O3A,Meg M.,4,4-Aug-10,Good Phone that could use a few tweaks,"I've gone through several phones in the last few years - whenever my rebates would apply I would upgrade. Last year I settled on the Alias 2, mostly because of the e-ink technology. I was impressed at first but the excitement of the new phone wore off as it always does. Regardless, it remains a trustworthy phone. Hopefully Samsung's newer versions of the Alias will fix a few flaws that I've run into, not the least of which is a slow system. When you're in the middle of typing a text and a new text comes in, the phone freezes momentarily before saving the text-in-progress in a draft and showing you the new text. The fact that the phone saves the text is good - but it would be better if the incoming text flew to the background and the phone allowed you to continue your typing. I've had to learn that when I'm typing a text and the phone stops registering what I'm trying to enter, I have to stop pushing buttons. If you give it a second, it'll resume normal running - otherwise, you might accidentally delete the incoming text. The same goes for trying to take a picture while a text comes in - except the picture doesn't save. Occasionally the phone gets confused - if you flip from landscape to vertical positions too fast, the keys and screen don't change, even after you push a few buttons. It continues to operate as if it were in vertical mode, even though the phone is flipped to the normal position. I like that I can switch from vertical to horizontal and back while in the middle of a text, but this only works if you flip fast enough (there's plenty of time - plus if you close the phone and don't flip fast enough, it simply saves your draft) and doesn't apply to any application other than an in-progress text. There's a decent signal with the Alias 2 - my previous phone was a cheap-o so I noticed an improvement in the signal but I can't verify that it's better than the enV or Omnia or other higher-end phone. If you're considering this phone, take into consideration that none of the cases, including the slimmest clear plastic ones, fit very well on the dual-hinge. They don't prevent the phone from opening, but they do cause a strain on the hinge when flipped in landscape mode and they make phone bulkier than necessary. In terms of size, it has a great feel. It's probably a little bit taller than most phones (about the size of the enV Touch and the orignal enV) but it's very slim and definitely pocket-sized. The keyboard, both in landscape and vertical modes, is a great size and perfect for texting. The keys have a unique feel and are not too big and not too small. The front display provides access to your music and taking a picture self-portrait style. (I've seen some complaints that this isn't possible - it is, you have to hold down the play/pause button then the skip-back button to activate the camera. You can see a preview of the picture and simply press the play/pause button again to take the pic.) The front display also allows you to see text message previews and a quick response with the ""Quick texts"" ... You have to have ""Auto-display text"" options set - a feature I didn't discover until I'd had the phone for six or seven months. (Probably should have read the manual!) The volume for the speaker and the mic are good - I haven't had trouble with not being able to hear anyone or with them hearing me. The speaker phone can be a bit crackly if it's up all the way, but full volume is not necessary as it is plenty loud. When the phone is closed, i.e. listening to music - it needs to be up a bit louder and therefore is sometimes crackly but I'm satifisied with it. After all, it's phone, not a iPod dock. All-in-all, this is a great phone with just a few minor problems. I'm still happy with it after the initial novelty has worn off, even though I'm lusting after an enV Touch (just my personal fickleness when it comes to phones!) I'm saving my money, however, and holding onto the trusty Alias 2.",
B0029F2O3A,The Wild Bat,3,10-Jul-09,resets when receiving calls,"The messaging features are nice. Typing text messages is not so much of a hassle with the keyboard. Also, the screen is quite pretty. I have found the morphing keyboard to be a great feature. When receiving calls, the phone works over half the time, but it sometimes resets when I attempt to answer calls. Also, at other times it lights up when a call is coming in, but won't actually finish the process and start ringing, so I don't know who actually called until they tell me later. I'm beginning to kick myself for signing a contract for service with this phone, and I suspect that it is going to be a pain in the butt until the contract is up.",
B0029F2O3A,Kaity Lynn,4,16-Oct-09,Good phone for daily use -,"I have been using this phone for a few days now and I like it. I am not a big ""gadget phone"" fan, preferring a simpler device that does just what I want. The voice quality is acceptable and after a short learning cycle is easy to use. The Alias 2 allows me, a novice texter, to send and receive text messages with no real hassles. The keypad is a great size, even for my larger fingers. I would have given 5 stars, except for the learning curve required to figure the phone out. Not that this is bad, but it is definitely different than the older phones I was used to.",
B0029F2O3A,Susan C,3,3-Jul-09,"Nice phone, but features don't deliver","I've had this phone for a couple of months. It's pretty cool in the way the screen and keypad can be used in either portrait or landscape. However, the keys don't have good tactile feedback. I have to type with my fingernail in order to press the keys hard enough and accurately. Its voice recognition software is worthless, so if you are accustomed to using this feature to dial (such as in the car using an earpiece), don't bother. The camera and camcorder work very well and the quality of the pictures and display are really good. The battery in this phone doesn't last near as long as my old LG, however this phone has many more features, so I think the battery life is acceptable. It's got a sleek design and it's fun to use, however, I don't think I'd buy another one because of the usability issues.",
B0029F2O3A,girlnextdoor,5,26-Sep-10,Anyone else having this problem?,"My Alias 2 keeps shutting off, even with a full charge. I thought it might be a problem with my battery until my husband's phone started doing the same thing...several times a day! Since then, we have heard of two other people having the same problem with the Alias 2. The local Verizon store offered a software update, but with no guarantee that it would correct the problem. They claim that this phone wasn't a big seller, and they have never heard of this problem before. They refuse to look into the problem, saying that's just the nature of electronic devices...no guarantees. Anyone else having this problem?",
B0029F2O3A,Susan J. Brillhart,5,2-Mar-10,LOVE my Samsung Alias 2!,"Had a Samsung A-310 for 6 years...a die-hard, sturdy phone. Wanted the same, with improved features. Looked for a flip phone (no purse-calling) that was intuitive, and had decent-sized keys to start texting - and this is it. You have SOOOO much room, because the keyboard changes with your need. Easy to use - intuitive for basic functions. If you choose to read the manual, there is a LOT more there. It's wonderful - thanks Samsung!!!",
B0029F2O3A,Teresa M.,2,17-Nov-09,Locks up when using MP3 Player,"Overall I like the phone for its call quality. I love the keyboard and find it very easy to type text messages. I haven't used the camera or the Bluetooth features. I can access my email accounts easily. The main problem with the phone is that locks up when I attempt to use the MP3 player. I have an 8GB MicroSD card with all of my music on it. I hook the phone up to my car radio to play it. Everything was fine for the first month, but now the phone locks up or freezes when it's in media mode and the only way to unlock it is to remove and then replace the battery. Very annoying. The phone has also turned off several times when I was attempting to answer a call.",
B0029F2O3A,Karen S. Baird,5,11-Jun-09,excellent,"This is a excellent phone great talk time, excellent standby, very user friendly, I may state it takes a little time to get use to but so does it when you change to new anything. The only down fall is the top 3 keys when your texting when you have large fingers, besides that I would recommend this phone to anybody my wife and kids go through phones like water so had many phones but this one is very unique exspecially with the flip screen. The pictures are excellent minus not having a flash i can live with that cause in low light still takes excellent pics. The flashes on all other phones are a joke those are only good for a couple of foot so take how you want but I recommend this phone for anybody men or women is is very unique. Only gripe is for my wife could be in different colors but my gripe is 3 top buttons could be different thanks for reading Jeff.",
B0029F2O3A,Erik Lindstrom,1,4-Oct-10,Worst cell phone I have ever owned,"Don't bother with this piece of junk. It is the worst phone I have ever owned. Turns itself off inexplicably 15 times a day. Shuts down in the middle of a conversation. So embarrassing. If you ""close"" it too fast, it shuts down. Also, the body of the phone is way too ""slippery"" --- I have dropped it out of my hand a dozen times only because it's too darn slippery to hold. Impossible to flip open the phone with one hand, you need both hands to open it. Terrible product. I am thinking about quitting Verizon simply because they offer this POS phone. Don't waste your time or money with this junk.",
B0029F2O3A,Dale E. Owens III,4,23-Nov-09,Great little tool,"I got mine for free with the purchase of my wife's blackberry. With the understanding that this is not a full computer, its a great tool tpo give you quick access to the internet. I really don't like working on lap tops, so only own a desktop. This leaves me limited in where I can have access to the internet. This thing gives me access everywhere. I have wireless in the house and I use the broadband everywhere else. Because it is only a netbook it does have its limitations. If you are looking for a full featured machine, this is not for you. But for quick access to the internet and most files, its great.",
B0029F2O3A,Vivek,5,5-Jun-09,Creative Design but Poor Phone,"Pros: Creative use of buttons, big screen, qwerty keyboard Cons: Doesn't sync with Outlook, clunky user interface, muddled audio in ear piece/speakerphone I really have to give credit to Samsung because of the creatively designed keypad, but I don't recommend this phone overall. The phone user interface isn't simple, and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you're on. For example, there's an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout, takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm (I guess I've been spoiled by almost always owning Nokias, as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces). Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon. Also, Verizon disables any Bluetooth syncing capabilities with Outlook, even for the few Nokias they offer.) Overall, the phone is designed creatively, but its hip design doesn't make up for its poor UI and lack of features that were essential to me.",
B0029F2O3A,n. country boy,4,6-Oct-10,never had a problem,never had a problem have had this phone for over 1 year camera takes decent not great pics nice big buttons for texting call quality excellent battery life pretty good all in all a happy camper,
B0029F2O3A,Kyle Griswold,1,29-Oct-09,Terrible,Has some real ram issues. It is really unusable. It takes a good 3 minutes just to run a program. I got mine for free for signing up for Fios and I feel like I got ripped off. I thought it would be a nice little thing because we only have 1 computer in my house. But really this can be used for nothing more than a paper weight. DO NOT BUY. I had to give 1 star because 0 stars wasn't an option.,
B0029F2O3A,Seth B. Tropinsky,5,27-Jul-09,Wonderful innovative keypad,"Great phone, which has the comfort of a larger phone, mixed with a very easy to use qwerty keyboard. the keyboard has nice space, and a texture that feels like the kindle. With the touch of a button, the QWERTY turns into 1234, or /?!> ect. Just a need phone, highly recommended.",
B0029F2O3A,A-la Dawn,5,30-Mar-11,Best fone ever!!!,"I have had this fone for two years, and have not had one problem with it.......love the magic keys.....will wait till the Alias 3 comes out to upgrade and it better have the magic keys!",
B0029F2O3A,B. Hopper,5,20-Sep-09,Great Phone!,I just got this phone a couple days ago and I am in love. It works great. Texting is a breeze. Great size.,
B0029F2O3A,Mini,5,18-Aug-09,"Great E Ink technology, but overall not quite ready for prime time yet...","The first time I heard about the Samsung Alias I thought I was in for a unique phone/messaging experience. After all, it contains the E Ink powered keyboard technology where keys can transform from vertical to horizontal and from regular to QWERTY keyboard at the touch of a button and using the dual-flip style that makes this phone more than just the typical flip phone. The first release had its faults, which is why Samsung and Verizon have released the Alias 2. The phone has its improvements. The best one is the fact that, when flipped open sideways, you get enough room to navigate and type with the QWERTY keyboard. The keys are not as crammed in together as the first Alias, for more comfortable typing. The phone also contains GPS, VCast Music with Rhapsody, web e-mail , IM capabilities and a mobile web browser. You can use these features with Verizon's fast EV-DO/3 G network. The phone also has a user-friendly menu and beautiful internal and external display. It's got 80 MB of internal memory (memory expandable to 16 GB with a media card) and a 2 MP camera with some nice, though limited video-recording capabilities. The Alias 2, though an improvement from the original Alias, has its downsides. For one thing, it looks outdated. At a mere glance, it looks like a typical flip phone that's been out for years. It only comes in one color (grayish black), and there's nothing about it that makes it attractive or unique at first glance. The keys are difficult to press. I had to press the keys rather hard every time I used the QWERTY keyboard. My thumbs ached after a while. The OS is quirky. It froze on me quite a few times and I had to do a force reboot. Very annoying when you're in the middle of sending a text message or checking your e-mail. And that's another thing, the calling, or lack thereof. I had about three dropped calls in one day. That's a lot for a phone, especially when I had most if not all network bars. What gives? And last but not least, the phone contains the same old Verizon menu and looks. The only nice thing about it is that you can personalize the internal and external screens with some cute animated wallpaper or other. All in all, the Samsung Alias 2 has all the makings for a popular messaging/multimedia phone. However, I don't think it's quite ready for prime time yet. A slicker design would be nice as well as some improved features and smoother keys. If you're in the bargain for a messaging phone that's stylish as well as functional, and you're in the Verizon network, I strongly recommend the LG enV3 or the enV Touch. You cannot go wrong with those two phones. In the meantime, if you really want this phone, make sure you weigh in the pros and cons before you decide to commit to it for two long years.",
B0029F2O3A,Jody,4,20-Oct-09,Fun phone,"Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: I am NOT a techie nor a tycoon who needs continual internet access lest the global market crash. I need a basic phone, and want a few bells and whistles. I replaced a basic LG cell phone with the Alias2 on the recommendation of a friend. I immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays, though I swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page. Pros: I LOVE having dedicated keys for voicemail, bluetooth and voice menus. The rotating keypad is just too cool for words, and though I don't send many texts, I use the notepad all the time. The QWERTY keyboard is very easy to use, even with fingernails. It's nice to know I can check email and have internet access if necessary, though I probably never will. The camera is great, and I like the editing options for pictures. The screen size is generous and easy to see, especially in landscape mode. It's easy to use. Sound quality is good. Nice long life of battery charge. Cons: The default backgrounds, though those are easy enough to change. Some functions are difficult to find on the menus. That's how I found the voicemail key--couldn't find VM on a menu. The ring isn't loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket--but I've never found a phone with a loud enough ring. There's not a button on the outside that will light up the display--to check the time, you have to open the phone. (ETA: Yes, there is--it just takes a few seconds for the display to light. Duh.) This phone was a good choice for me, and I'm very happy with it.",
B0029F2O3A,W. Miller,5,13-Jun-09,"Good phone, horrible features","Calls are fine; battery life is terrific compared to the LG phone I just discarded. Nearly identical software found on every other Verizon phone I've had, yet the standard issue ring tones on this one are pretty bad. Great camera, HOWEVER, no support Bluetooth file system profile -- nor support for marking multiple photos for push, meaning that I have to push each picture painfully and slowly one by one to my PC via Bluetooth. So I should be done pushing the 100 or so pics I took today in about 28 days... lovely. Also, END key is right next to the SPACE key. If you inadvertently tap END while using the mobile web, it exits no matter what/where you are and it is absolutely maddening while you're trying to learn the keypad layout. Time on the front display is permanently set to 12-hr mode. I don't think I'm going to keep this one for long.",
B0029F2O3A,Bob,3,15-Jun-09,"OK Phone, Bluetooth stereo audio is awful, voice recognition is unusable","The real standout feature on this phone is keyboard. I made the mistake of assuming that the mp3 bluetooth audio would be at least as good as my original LG chocolate from 3 years ago, especially since verizon just copies its old OS onto everything. The bluetooth stereo is almost unusable, very tinny, no way to adjust the sound profile. If you plug a wire in it sounds great, but not very useful. Phone call quality is ok. it has a spot for upto 16GB card, which would be perfect if it was useful as an MP3 player. If it wasn't too late to return it , I would. Also the Voice recognition is not accurate or useful, something else that used to work flawlessly with my 3yr old chocolate.",
B0029F2O3A,Kenneth Michael Mcneil,5,3-Jun-10,Surprisingly Durable,"As a teenager, I do a lot of texting. This phone has a great full QWERTY keyboard or if you want, a number pad. The changing keys are cool and people go ooo! and ahh! as they see you flip it both ways. The 2 megapixel camera is good for recording video and photos. There is only a small piece holding the screen to the bottom unit in the corner that seems flimsy from the pictures. It is NOT a flimsy device. This was not a problem. In fact, while walking home on a trail I dropped it without realizing it. The next day I was looking for it all over. When I was walking on the trail I noticed it in the mud. I was mortified because people drive ATV/Quads all over the trail. Upon lifting up the phone I saw that it had been run over and caked in mud. I knew it was not going to work because of how wet it was. Amazingly, it worked fine. I got home and brushed it with a paper towel. It's as good as new. The only problem is that you have to change the keyboard layout in order to get to the numbers. This makes it just as hard to type the number 4 as it is to type four. It's a nice reliable little phone. If you are interested in a standard phone for texting and calling, this is great for you. Pros: Durable Reliable good for texting Cons: A little slow sometimes It's slippery Not a smartphone but it's a cheap one The best secret feature is that if you scratch the back a certain way it makes a cool noise like scratching a record.",
B0029F2O3A,Cspell,5,16-Sep-09,Voice Activation Dreadful,"I love the e-ink technology (the qwerty keyboard is great for texting), but that is the highlight. The huge drawback, if you need to make calls with the bluetooth, is that the voice activation system is useless. My old phone worked flawelessly in this area, but with the Alias 2, if I say, ""Call John Smith,"" IF it responds (and many times it doesn't), it will say, ""Did you say dial 123?"" or some other number, or name that is nothing like the one I've said. It's incredibly frustrating. I don't want to look at my phone as I am driving, that is why I rely on the Voice Activation/Bluetooth to make my calls. Without voice activation working properly, I am looking at my phone, scrolling through my address book, and just generally distracted instead of focusing on the road. SO DISAPPOINTING.",
B0029F2O3A,E. Stidd,5,21-Jun-10,"Awesome ""mini"" computer!","I got this thing and loved it. It is great mini computer for everyday on the go use. Nice size, screen is not too small but not too big either. Keyboard is just as easy to use as a large keyboard. Operating system if you get it in XP works well on this little PC. It does just about everything a large one would do but more portable. I would recommend!",
B0029F2O3A,Rebecca Balch,5,1-Oct-09,NEVER BUY THIS ONE,"My daughter and I both got the LG enV2 about 8 months ago. We're currently waiting for our third version of this. Both phones of our first phones failed within 5 months (keys stopped working on outside, dropped calls, goes back to menu in middle of texting, calls contacts at random times and much more). We got ""new"" ones, which were refurbished phones from Verizon. They lasted a few months before failing with similar problems, plus now I have almost no volume even though its maxed on the setting. We're waiting for our next set of ""new"" phones to arrive later this week. Can't wait to see how long these last. The upgrade to a different phone isn't an option until you've been in the contract one year and can only upgrade one phone then.",
B002AS9WEA,wakajawaka,1,20-Aug-13,Because it was phased out by AT&T,Problem: phone was phased out by AT&T so i couldn't even use it or buy sim card or anything for it! AT&T should inform sellers!!,
B002AS9WEA,Amazon Customer,2,5-Jan-17,Two Stars,to old,
B002AS9WEA,Teresa M Smith,4,10-Oct-12,Good little phone,This is the third phone I've purchased for my son since we switched him to AT&T. The first two were the same phone and were no good within a few months. This one has lasted him almost a year now. He likes it and I like not having to replace it all the time.,
B002AS9WEA,rakel vera,5,30-Dec-13,thanks,"thank you so much, and thanks for everything, i need, i want, i love it, its excellent, wonderful, forever thanks",
